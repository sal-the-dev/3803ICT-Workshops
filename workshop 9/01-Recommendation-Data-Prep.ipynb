For example, a user may have defined interests (fishing, soccer, etc.) and a product may have associated categories (sporting gear, clothing, etc.). Recommendations of this type are given based on the similarity between the user's features and the product's features.\n",
    "- rating-based: Here, recommendations are based by matching a user's interests/ratings with other similar users. The information from similar users is then extroplated to estimate the user's ratings for items they have not yet interacted with. In comparison with the content-based systems, this model may struggle with regular insertions of new information (user similarities must be constantly re-calculated) and with sparisty (what happens at the start, when no one has any interests or ratings?).\n",
    "- clustering-based: This approach extends the rating-based models by clustering the information either by users or ratings. Users can then be given recommendations in alignment with the clusters. The cluster approach attempts to overcome some of the limitations introduced in the naive rating-based model such as sparsity.
